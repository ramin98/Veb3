The New York Post (NY Post) is an American conservative[3] daily tabloid newspaper published in New York City. The Post also operates three online sites, NYPost.com,[4] PageSix.com, a gossip site, and Decider.com, an entertainment site.

The newspaper was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton, a Federalist and Founding Father who was appointed the nation's first Secretary of the Treasury by George Washington. The newspaper became a respected broadsheet in the 19th century, under the name New York Evening Post.[5] Its most notable 19th-century editor was William Cullen Bryant.

In the mid-20th century, the newspaper was owned by Dorothy Schiff, who developed the tabloid format that has been used since by the newspaper. In 1976, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp bought the Post for US$30.5 million.[6]

The New York Post is the ninth-largest circulation newspaper in the U.S. as of 2023.[7]
